# Temperature_Conversion

This Python script converts a given temperature between Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). It defines functions for all possible conversions and prompts the user to input a temperature value and its unit. Based on the input unit, it calculates and displays the equivalent temperatures in the other two units. The script ensures accurate conversions and handles invalid unit inputs gracefully.
